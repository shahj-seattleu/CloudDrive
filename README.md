## File Structure
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The Node.js package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v8.7.x`+ (or `v7.10.1`) and NPM `5.x.x`+


## Installing on MacOSX
The preferred method for installing Node.js, is to use the versions available in package managers, such as apt-get, Macports

## Using MacPorts

sudo port install nodejs npm
which node
node --version
```

## Using Homebrew
```bash
brew search node
brew install node
```
